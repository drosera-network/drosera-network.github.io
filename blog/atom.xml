        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the rapidly evolving world of decentralized finance (DeFi), security is paramount. The DeFi ecosystem has experienced numerous exploits and hacks resulting in millions of dollars in losses for various protocols. To address these issues, we present Drosera, a native Ethereum solution designed to provide robust security primitives and foster a more secure and robust DeFi environment.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_iAQ0" id="understanding-drosera">Understanding Drosera<a href="#understanding-drosera" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Understanding Drosera" title="Direct link to Understanding Drosera">​</a></h2><p>Drosera is a trustless and decentralized infrastructure for detecting exploits and mitigating financial loss. It is an automation protocol that abstracts the complexity of creating monitoring systems for decentralized applications. Drosera offers a framework for creating and executing automated responses to events on the Ethereum network, enabling developers to create more secure and robust applications.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_iAQ0" id="the-need-for-drosera">The Need for Drosera<a href="#the-need-for-drosera" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Need for Drosera" title="Direct link to The Need for Drosera">​</a></h2><p>The DeFi ecosystem has witnessed an alarming number of exploits and hacks in recent years. These incidents have not only resulted in significant financial losses but have also undermined the trust and confidence of users in the DeFi space. Drosera was born out of the need for a more robust and decentralized security system for DeFi protocols, one that is more native to the Ethereum ecosystem with a strong foundation that can be built upon.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_iAQ0" id="simplicity-and-developer-friendliness">Simplicity and Developer Friendliness<a href="#simplicity-and-developer-friendliness" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Simplicity and Developer Friendliness" title="Direct link to Simplicity and Developer Friendliness">​</a></h2><p>Drosera's design prioritizes developer operations and experience. It seamlessly integrates with existing Solidity tooling and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. This allows developers to create and deploy secure DeFi applications with ease, fostering a more secure and efficient DeFi ecosystem.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_iAQ0" id="droseras-unique-capabilities">Drosera's Unique Capabilities<a href="#droseras-unique-capabilities" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Drosera's Unique Capabilities" title="Direct link to Drosera's Unique Capabilities">​</a></h2><p>Drosera gives smart contracts the ability to analyze a well-formatted history of on-chain data. This allows the detection of invariants that change over time instead of just looking at the current state of the blockchain. This powerful capability enables the creation of more sophisticated analsysis that can detect a wide range of invariant condidtions.</p><p>These smart cotracts are called Traps, and they implement two functions, <code>collect</code> and <code>isValid</code>. The <code>collect</code> function is responsible for gathering data from the blockchain and returning a struct with data points to monitor. The <code>isValid</code> function accepts an array of the returned struct and returns a bool. This function is called by the Operator on every new block with the collected data and is used to determine whether or not the Trap response should be executed.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_iAQ0" id="general-use-cases">General Use Cases<a href="#general-use-cases" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to General Use Cases" title="Direct link to General Use Cases">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_iAQ0" id="treasury-management">Treasury Management<a href="#treasury-management" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Treasury Management" title="Direct link to Treasury Management">​</a></h3><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_iAQ0" id="defi-lending-platforms">DeFi Lending Platforms<a href="#defi-lending-platforms" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to DeFi Lending Platforms" title="Direct link to DeFi Lending Platforms">​</a></h3><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_iAQ0" id="decentralized-exchanges">Decentralized Exchanges<a href="#decentralized-exchanges" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Decentralized Exchanges" title="Direct link to Decentralized Exchanges">​</a></h3>]]></content>
