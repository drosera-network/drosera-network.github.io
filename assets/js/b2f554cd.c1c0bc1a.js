It is an automation protocol that abstracts the complexity of creating monitoring systems for decentralized applications. Drosera offers a framework for creating and executing automated responses to events on the Ethereum network, enabling developers to create more secure and robust applications.\\n\\n## The Need for Drosera\\n\\nThe DeFi ecosystem has witnessed an alarming number of exploits and hacks in recent years. These incidents have not only resulted in significant financial losses but have also undermined the trust and confidence of users in the DeFi space. Drosera was born out of the need for a more robust and decentralized security system for DeFi protocols, one that is more native to the Ethereum ecosystem with a strong foundation that can be built upon.\\n\\n## Simplicity and Developer Friendliness\\n\\nDrosera\'s design prioritizes developer operations and experience. It seamlessly integrates with existing Solidity tooling and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. This allows developers to create and deploy secure DeFi applications with ease, fostering a more secure and efficient DeFi ecosystem.\\n\\n## Drosera\'s Unique Capabilities\\n\\nDrosera gives smart contracts the ability to analyze a well-formatted history of on-chain data. This allows the detection of invariants that change over time instead of just looking at the current state of the blockchain. This powerful capability enables the creation of more sophisticated analsysis that can detect a wide range of invariant condidtions.\\n\\nThese smart cotracts are called Traps, and they implement two functions, `collect` and `isValid`. The `collect` function is responsible for gathering data from the blockchain and returning a struct with data points to monitor. The `isValid` function accepts an array of the returned struct and returns a bool. This function is called by the Operator on every new block with the collected data and is used to determine whether or not the Trap response should be executed.\\n\\n## General Use Cases\\n\\n### Treasury Management\\n\\n### DeFi Lending Platforms\\n\\n### Decentralized Exchanges"}]}')}}]);
