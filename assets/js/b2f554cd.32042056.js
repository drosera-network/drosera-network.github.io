It is an automation protocol that abstracts the complexity of creating monitoring systems, and automated response capability, for decentralized applications. Drosera offers a framework for creating and executing automated responses to events on the Ethereum network.\\n\\nThe vision for what Drosera will become is symbiotic: a biome, wherein a new economy of scale is born from the participation of protocols, their communities, operators, and restakers.\\n\\nOperators win because they make more money and provide application layer security for Ethereum.\\n\\nProtocols win by receiving dynamic, objective, and trustless security that is delivered around the clock - bolstered by voluntary participation from their community.\\n\\nRestakers win by receiving yield for providing economic security using their assets.\\nDrosera wins because we generate rewards for protocol adoption.\\n\\n## Drosera\'s Unique Capabilities\u200b\\n\\nDrosera is the world\u2019s first decentralized automated responder collective (DARC), one that is directly native to the Ethereum trust network with a strong foundation that can be built upon.\\n\\nDrosera empowers smart contracts with the ability to analyze a well-formatted history of on-chain data, allowing for the detection of invariants that change over time instead of just examining the current state of the blockchain. This capability enables the creation of sophisticated analysis that can detect a wide range of invariant conditions.\\n\\nThese smart contracts, called Traps, implement two functions: collect and isValid. The collect function gathers data from the blockchain and returns a struct containing the data points to monitor. The isValid function accepts an array of the returned struct and returns a boolean value. This function is called by the Operator on each new block with the collected data, and it is used to determine whether or not the Trap\'s response should be executed.\\n\\nBy using Solidity to structure traps, we not only equip developers and projects with a powerful security tool but introduce the potential for an entirely new discipline of security engineer in a Web3 context: Trappers, professionals who specialize in structuring the validation logic found for protocols and users.\\n\\n## General Use Cases\u200b\\nDrosera can create immediate value for several use cases:\\n\\nFor **treasury management**, a protocol can use Drosera to monitor the state of its treasury and execute an emergency response if the treasury is drained or if the funds are moved to an unauthorized address.\\n\\nFor **lending platforms**, projects can implement automated liquidation alerts and responses, the protocol can detect if a user\'s collateralization ratio drops below a critical level and initiate an automated response to either notify the user or trigger partial liquidation to avoid full liquidation.\\n\\nFor **decentralized exchanges**, you can create a system to detect unusual trading activity \u2013 the protocol can monitor trading volumes, liquidity, and pool data to identify potential market manipulation or unwanted bot activity and inform governance.\\n\\nThis list is by no means comprehensive, but rather illustrative of straightforward use cases we typically highlight for our partners. We intend to do entire blog posts on the additional use cases Drosera offers to different profiles of protocols.\\n\\n## Alignment\u200b\\n\\nDrosera distinguishes itself as a community-aligned platform, simplifying the creation of monitoring systems for protocol developers. By solely leveraging Solidity, Drosera offers a streamlined approach that significantly reduces both cost and development time compared to traditional in-house solutions. \\nThis seamless integration complements existing smart contract development tooling and workflows, enhancing efficiency without disrupting established processes.\\n\\nIn the realm of Ethereum, operators have a unique opportunity to contribute to the security and stability of the DeFi ecosystem. By running the Drosera Operator Client software, they can actively engage in the network\'s safeguarding. Opting into \'Traps\'\u2014a key feature of Drosera\u2014allows these operators to not only play a crucial role in protecting the ecosystem but also to earn rewards for their contributions. \\n\\nThis innovative approach encourages active participation and provides tangible incentives, fostering a more secure and robust DeFi environment.\\n\\n## Thank you,\u200b\\n\\nWe would like to take this time to thank our partners, investors, and stakeholders who have contributed the initial seed to the growth of new security capability for our industry.\\n\\n\\nIf you have any questions or would like to learn more about Drosera, please feel free to reach out to us on our [Discord](https://twitter.com/DroseraNetwork) channels or [X](https://twitter.com/DroseraNetwork). We are always happy to help and engage with the community."}]}')}}]);
